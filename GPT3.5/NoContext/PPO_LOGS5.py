 Arjun has x amount of money. 
 
 Sajal has y amount of money. 
 
 When Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. 
 
 So, y + 30 = 2x 
 
 When Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. 
 
 So, x + 10 = 3y 
 
 Solving the two equations, we get 
 
 x = 62 
 
 y = 34 
 
 Therefore, the answer is C)34, 62.

 We know that the width of the yard is 100 feet. 
 We also know that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. 
 
 We can use the formula for area of a rectangle to solve this problem. 
 
 Area = Length x Width 
 
 3,000 = Length x 100 
 
 Length = 3,000/100 
 
 Length = 30 feet 
 
 Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

 The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. 
 
 This means that the two integers have 11 as a common factor. 
 
 The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. 
 
 This means that the two integers have 7700 as their least common multiple. 
 
 We know that one of the integers is 350. 
 
 We can use the fact that the greatest common factor of two integers is the product of the two integers divided by their least common multiple. 
 
 Therefore, the other integer is (11 x 350) / 7700 = 412. 
 
 Hence, the answer is [[D]].

 Step 1: The original piece of cloth is a square. 
 
 Step 2: The square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece. 
 
 Step 3: The rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. 
 
 Step 4: The area of each of the triangles is 70 square feet. 
 
 From the given information, we can calculate the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth. 
 
 The area of a triangle is given by A = 1/2 * b * h, where b is the base and h is the height. 
 
 Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can calculate the base and height of each triangle. 
 
 b = 14 feet 
 
 h = 10 feet 
 
 The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is given by P = 4 * b = 4 * 14 = 56 feet. 
 
 Therefore, the answer is [[A]].

 Step 1: The ratio of reduction is 5:3.
 
 Step 2: This means that the ribbon was reduced by 5 parts out of 8 parts.
 
 Step 3: The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm.
 
 Step 4: So, the length of the ribbon now is 30 cm - (5/8) √ó 30 cm = 18 cm.
 
 Hence, the answer is [[A]].

 M = abc
 
 N = cba
 
 M > N
 
 M - N + 396c = 990
 
Substituting the values of M and N,

abc - cba + 396c = 990

100a + 10b + c - 100c - 10b - a + 396c = 990

100a + 396c = 990

a = 990 - 396c/100

Now, for M to be more than 300,

abc > 300

990 - 396c/100 > 3

990 - 396c > 300

690 > 396c

c > 1.7

Since c is a single digit number, c can only be 2 or more.

Therefore, the number of values of M more than 300 is 40.

 20% of the students took physics, so 80% of the students did not take physics.
 
 28% of the students took math, so 72% of the students did not take math.

 Arjun has x amount of money. 
 
 Sajal has y amount of money. 
 
 When Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. 
 
 So, y + 30 = 2x 
 
 When Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. 
 
 So, x + 10 = 3y 
 
 Solving the two equations, we get 
 
 x = 62 
 
 y = 34 
 
 So, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. 
 
 Answer: [[C]], 34, 62
