################IMPROEMENT################# 0 The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? A)$61  B)$65  C)$67.40  D)$70  E)$78.20  
  
                    
What is the discounted price of the item?
What is the original price of the item?
What is the total price of the item?
What is the difference between the total price and the discounted price?
What is the difference between the difference and the original price?</s> 
 . 
 
 Step 1: The original price of the item is x. 
 
 Step 2: The customer pays $1.90 more than half the original price of the item. 
 
 So, x/2 + 1.90 = x 
 
 Solving for x, we get x = 3.90 
 
 Therefore, the original price of the item is $3.90. 
 
 Answer: [[E]]. $3.90.
