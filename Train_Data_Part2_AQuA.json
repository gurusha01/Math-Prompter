Next, it takes 12 seconds to pass a man walking at 5 km/hr in the same direction. Find the length of the train and that of the platform.\nDistance = Speed*time\nIt's probably best to convert to meters so we can find the length of the platform.\nDistance = 25000 meters/h * 18 seconds*(1/60*60)\nDistance =(25000*18 / [3600] ) = 125m\nI'm not sure how we take the length of the train into account (if we do at all) to solve this problem. For example, If we were measuring by the time the very front of the train passed one end of the platform to the time the very front of the train passed the other end, the result would be different than if we counted when the very front of the train passed one end of the platform to the time the back side of the train passed the end.\nAs for the problem involving the man, the man is standing still while the train is moving forward at a speed of 25km/h. Therefore, the train is moving past the man at a total speed of 25km/h.\ndistance = speed * time\ndistance = 25km/h * 12 seconds\ndistance (length of train) = 83.3 m\nWe know the length of the train is roughly 83.3m and the distance covered passing the platform was 125m. However, The platform isn't 125m long - it is 125m minus the length of the train long (or so I think) which is 125-83.3 or roughly 41.7m.

First its given|-a| < 5 ==> |a| < 5 ===> |a-0| < 5 ==> the distance from zero is less than 5.

We know that x is the width, and x-3 is the length, so by using the roots, we get 13 as the width (x), and 10 as the length (x-3).\nOnce we have this, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the diagonal.

", "Reasoning": "Here is my explanation. The question states:S is a set containing 9 different positive odd primes. T is a set containing 8 different numbers, all of which are members of S. Which of the following statements CANNOT be true?\n(A) The median of S is prime.\nThismust be true. If there are an odd number of members of a set, then the median is a member of the set: it's the middle number, when all the numbers are ranked from smallest to biggest. Every number in S is a positive odd prime, so the median is one of them, and is prime.\n(B) The median of T is prime.\nThismay or may not be true. If a set has an even number of members, the median is average of the two numbers in the middle, when ranked from smallest to biggest. The average of two odd numberscould beeven (average of 71 and 73 is 72), and hence not prime, or itcould beodd (the average of 71 and 79 is 75). For particularly well chosen odd numbers, the average can be not only odd but also prime -- for example, the average of 89 and 113 is 101, another prime number. If the two middle numbers of T were 89 and 113, the median would be 101, a prime number.\n(C) The median of S is equal to the median of T.\nUnder most configurations for S and T, this wouldn't happen. If you weren't trying to make it happen, it would be unlikely to happen by chance. BUT, if the number dropped going from from S to T was the median of S (say, 101), and if the two middle numbers of T happen to have an average of that number that was dropped (for example, if the two numbers were 89 and 113), then the medians would be equal. In other words, the three middle numbers of S would have to be {. . ., 89, 101, 133, . . .}, and when 101 is dropped in going to T, the median of two would be the average of 89113, which happens to be 101. It's an exceptional case, but itcouldbe true.\n(D) The sum of the terms in S is prime.\nThismay or may not be true. The sum of 9 odd numbermustbe an odd number. That odd numbercould beprime. For example, the sum of the first nine odd prime numbers {3, 5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} is 127, which is prime. If you drop 3 and include the next prime, 31, the set {5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31} has a sum of 155, which is clearly not prime.\n(E) The sum of the terms in T is prime.\nThismust be false. The sum of eight odd numbers must be an even number. Only 2 is prime, and all other even numbers are not. Therefore, the sum of eight odd prime numbers will be an even number bigger than two, and absolutely cannot be prime.\nC", "sub-questions": "\nWhat is the median of set S?\nWhat is the median of set T?\nWhat is the sum of the terms in set S?\nWhat is the sum of the terms in set T?\nWhat is the average of two odd numbers?\nWhat is the sum of the first nine odd prime numbers?"}
