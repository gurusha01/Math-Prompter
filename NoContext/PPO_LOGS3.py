                    What is the value of $x$ such that $(x-4)^2 \le 9$?

What is the length of the segment of the number line consisting of the points that satisfy $(x-4)^2 \le 9$ + "?
What is the value of $x$ such that $(x-4)^2 
 . 
 
 The given equation is $(x-4)^2 \le 9$. 
 
 This equation can be written as $-3 \le x-4 \le 3$. 
 
 Adding 4 to both sides, we get $1 \le x \le 7$. 
 
 Therefore, the length of the segment of the number line consisting of the points that satisfy $(x-4)^2 \le 9$ is 7-1 = 6. 
 
 Hence, the answer is [[Answer: 6]].

 $f^{-1}(19)$ is the inverse of $f(x)$ when $f(x)=19$.

 . 
 
 The graph of the equation $y=ax^2+bx-6$ is completely below the $x$-axis. 
 
 This means that the equation should have no real roots. 
 
 This implies that the discriminant of the equation should be negative. 
 
 The discriminant of the equation is given by $b^2-4ac$. 
 
 Here, $a=a$, $b=b$ and $c=-6$. 
 
 So, $b^2-4ac$ should be negative. 
 
 Since $a^2=49$, $a=\pm7$. 
 
 So, $b^2<24a$ 
 
 This implies that $b^2<168$. 
 
 So, the largest possible integral value of $b$ is 12.

 Step 1: We can multiply both sides of the equation by $(x-2)(x-5)$ to get
 \[5x-16=(A(x-5)+B(x-2))(x^2-7x+10).\]
 
 Step 2: We can equate the coefficients of $x$ and the constant terms to get
 \[A+B=5\]
 \[A+5B=-16\]
 
 Step 3: Solving the above equations, we get 
 
 \[A=3\]
 \[B=2\]

 . 
 
 We have two points (0, 0) and (9, 6). 
 
 We need to move $\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment. 
 
 So, the distance between the two points is 9 units. 
 
 $\frac{1}{3}$ of 9 is 3. 
 
 So, we need to move 3 units from (0, 0). 
 
 Now, the coordinates of the point we land upon will be (3, 2). 
 
 So, the sum of the coordinates of the point we land upon is 3 + 2 = 5.

 . 
 
 Step 1: We need to equate the two equations to find the points of intersection. 
 
 $$x^2+4x+6=\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+6$$
 
 Step 2: Simplifying the equation, we get 
 
 $$\frac{1}{2}x^2+3x=0$$
 
 Step 3: Solving the equation, we get 
 
 $$x=-6, x=0$$
 
 Step 4: Substituting the values of $x$ in the equation $y=x^2+4x+6$, we get 
 
 $$y=-36, y=6$$
 
 Step 5: Thus, the points of intersection are $(-6,-36)$ and $(0,6)$. 
 
 Step 6: Now, $c-a=0-(-6)=6$. 
 
 Hence, the answer is $c-a=6$.

 .
 
 We know that $6x^2 + 17x + 5$ can be written in the form $(Ax+1)(Bx+5)$.
 
 We can expand the expression $(Ax+1)(Bx+5)$ to get $Ax^2 + (A+B)x + 5$.
 
 Comparing this with the given expression, we get $A+B = 17$ and $AB = 6$.
 
 Therefore, the value of $AB$ is 6.

                    What is the sum of the first six integers?
</s> 
 . 
 
 The smallest of the seven integers is the first integer. 
 
 The sum of seven consecutive integers is 49. 
 
 This means that the first integer + the second integer + the third integer + the fourth integer + the fifth integer + the sixth integer + the seventh integer = 49. 
 
 We can represent this equation as x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) + (x + 6) = 49. 
 
 We can simplify this equation to 7x + 21 = 49. 
 
 We can then solve for x by subtracting 21 from both sides of the equation. 
 
 This gives us 7x = 28. 
 
 We can then divide both sides of the equation by 7 to get x = 4. 
 
 Therefore, the smallest of the seven integers is 4.

################IMPROEMENT################# 5 Find the magnitude of the complex number $5-12i$. 
  
                    
                    What is the magnitude of the complex number $5-12i$?
</s> 
 .
 
 Step 1: We need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the complex number.
 
 Step 2: The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
 
 Step 3: In this case, the hypotenuse is the magnitude of the complex number and the other two sides are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
 
 Step 4: The real part of the complex number is 5 and the imaginary part is -12.
 
 Step 5: We can now use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the complex number.
 
 Magnitude = $\sqrt{5^2 + (-12)^2}$
 
 Magnitude = $\sqrt{169}$
 
 Magnitude = 13
