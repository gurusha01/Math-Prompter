There are 3 sizes of squares, so there are 3 types of squares. 

The smallest square has 4 vertices, the medium square has 6 vertices and the largest square has 8 vertices. 

Therefore, the total number of vertices is 4 + 6 + 8 = 18. 

Since the vertices are points on the rectangular $3\times n$ grid, there are 3 rows and $n$ columns. 

Therefore, the total number of points is 3 $\times$ $n$ = 18. 

Hence, $n$ = 6.

 The first two digits can be any number from 0 to 9.
 
 The last digit can be any number from 0 to 9.
 
 The sum of the first two digits should be equal to the last digit.
 
 So, the last digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.
 
 For each of these last digits, there are 10 possible combinations of the first two digits.
 
 Therefore, the total number of $4$-digit numbers with the last digit equal to the sum of the first two digits is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

 First, we need to find the range of values of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$. 
 
 Since $1 \le a \le 10$ and $1 \le b \le 36$, the maximum value of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is $\sqrt{10 + \sqrt{36}} = \sqrt{46}$. 
 
 The minimum value of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1}} = \sqrt{2}$.

 Now, we need to find the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ for which $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is an integer. 
 
 Since the range of values of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is $\sqrt{2} \le \sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}} \le \sqrt{46}$, the only possible integer values of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ are $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{4}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{6}, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{8}, \sqrt{9}, \sqrt{10}, \sqrt{11}, \sqrt{12}, \sqrt{13}, \sqrt{14}, \sqrt{15}, \sqrt{16}, \sqrt{17}, \sqrt{18}, \sqrt{19}, \sqrt{20}, \sqrt{21}, \sqrt{22}, \sqrt{23}, \sqrt{24}, \sqrt{25}, \sqrt{26}, \sqrt{27}, \sqrt{28}, \sqrt{29}, \sqrt{30}, \sqrt{31}, \sqrt{32}, \sqrt{33}, \sqrt{34}, \sqrt{35}, \sqrt{36},

 The probability of drawing one white and one black ball is $\frac{10}{21}$.
 
 This means that the probability of drawing two white balls or two black balls is $\frac{11}{21}$.
 
 Since the probability of drawing two white balls is $\frac{5}{21}$, the probability of drawing two black balls is $\frac{6}{21}$.
 
 This means that the number of black balls must be at least 6.
 
 Therefore, the smallest possible value of $k$ is 6.

 The probability of drawing one white and one black ball is $\frac{10}{21}$.
 
 This means that the probability of drawing two white balls or two black balls is $\frac{11}{21}$.
 
 Since there are 5 white balls, the probability of drawing two white balls is $\frac{5}{21}$.
 
 Therefore, the probability of drawing two black balls is $\frac{6}{21}$.
 
 This means that the number of black balls must be at least 6.
 
 Therefore, the smallest possible value of $k$ is 6.

 The total number of balls in the bin is $5+k$.
 
 The probability of drawing one white and one black ball is $\frac{10}{21}$.
 
 This means that the number of ways of drawing one white and one black ball is $\frac{10}{21}$ times the total number of ways of drawing two balls from the bin.
 
 This can be written as:
 
 $\frac{10}{21} \times \frac{(5+k) \times (5+k-1)}{2} = \frac{10}{21} \times \frac{(5+k)(5+k-1)}{2}$
 
 Simplifying, we get:
 
 $\frac{10(5+k)(5+k-1)}{42} = 1$
 
 Solving for $k$, we get:
 
 $k = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 120}}{2} = 5 \pm \sqrt{15}$
 
 Since $k$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $k$ is $6$.

 First, we need to find the range of values of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$. 
 
 Since $1 \le a \le 10$ and $1 \le b \le 36$, the maximum value of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is $\sqrt{10 + \sqrt{36}} = \sqrt{46}$. 
 
 The minimum value of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1}} = \sqrt{2}$. 
 
 Therefore, the range of values of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is $\sqrt{2} \le \sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}} \le \sqrt{46}$. 
 
 Now, we need to find the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ for which $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is an integer. 
 
 Since the range of values of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ is $\sqrt{2} \le \sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}} \le \sqrt{46}$, the only possible integer values of $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ are $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{4}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{6}, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{8}, \sqrt{9}, \sqrt{10}, \sqrt{11}, \sqrt{12}, \sqrt{13}, \sqrt{14}, \sqrt{15}, \sqrt{16}, \sqrt{17}, \sqrt{18}, \sqrt{19}, \sqrt{20}, \sqrt{21}, \sqrt{22}, \sqrt{23}, \sqrt{24}, \sqrt{25}, \sqrt{26}, \sqrt{27}, \sqrt{28}, \sqrt{29}, \sqrt{30}, \sqrt{31}, \sqrt{32}, \sqrt{33}, \sqrt{34}, \sqrt{35}, \sqrt{36},

 First, we need to find the number of terms in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$.
 
 We can use the formula for the number of terms in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^n$ which is given by $n+2 \choose 2$.
 
 So, the number of terms in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is given by $8+2 \choose 2$ which is equal to $10 \choose 2$ which is equal to 45.
 
 Now, we need to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$.
 
 We can use the formula for the coefficient of $x^ay^bz^c$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^n$ which is given by $\frac{n!}{a!b!c!}$.
 
 So, the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is given by $\frac{8!}{3!3!2!}$ which is equal to [[Answer: 560]].

 9^4 = 6561
 
 9^5 = 59049
 
 We need to find the multiples of 729 which are greater than 6561 and less than 59049. 
 
 729 x 8 = 5832
 
 729 x 9 = 6561
 
 729 x 10 = 7320
 
 729 x 11 = 8089
 
 729 x 12 = 8858
 
 729 x 13 = 9627
 
 729 x 14 = 10396
 
 729 x 15 = 11165
 
 729 x 16 = 11934
 
 729 x 17 = 12703
 
 729 x 18 = 13472
 
 729 x 19 = 14241

 For $n = 2015$, $f(2015) = (1 + 3 + 3^2 + \cdots + 3^{2015}) - (1 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + 3^{2014})$. 
 
 Since $3^{2015}$ is the largest term in the first sum, the minimum value of $f(2015)$ is $3^{2015} - 3^{2014} = 3^{2014}$. 
 
 For $n > 2015$, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is $3^{n} - 3^{n-1} = 3^{n-1}$. 
 
 Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \ge 2015$ is [[Answer: 3^{2014}]].

 First, we need to find the values of $n$ for which $*(n)$ has exactly three distinct elements.
 
 We can see that $*(n)$ has three distinct elements when $n-2$, $n+2$ and $2n$ are distinct. This means that $n-2 \neq n+2$ and $n-2 \neq 2n$ and $n+2 \neq 2n$.
 
 This implies that $n \neq 0$ and $n \neq 4$.
 
 Now, let us consider the cases when $n$ is even and when $n$ is odd.
 
 When $n$ is even, $n-2$ and $n+2$ are both even and $2n$ is even. This means that $*(n)$ has only two distinct elements.
 
 When $n$ is odd, $n-2$ and $n+2$ are both odd and $2n$ is even. This means that $*(n)$ has three distinct elements.
 
 Therefore, the number of distinct integers $n$ for which $*(n)$ has exactly three distinct elements is equal to the number of odd integers.

 We know that $*(n) = \left\{ n-2, n+2, 2n, \frac{n}{2} \right\}$. 
 
 For $*(n)$ to have exactly three distinct elements, we need to have two elements that are equal. 
 
 This means that either $n-2 = n+2$ or $2n = \frac{n}{2}$. 
 
 Solving these equations, we get $n = 2$ and $n = 4$.

The player pays $\$5$ to play the game. 

If the number on the die is odd, the game is lost. 

If the number on the die is even, the die is rolled again. 

In this case, the player wins some amount of money if the second number matches the first and loses otherwise. 

Since the game is fair, the player should win the same amount of money that he/she paid to play the game. 

Therefore, the player should win $\$5$ if the game is fair.

 First, we need to find the total number of ways the representatives can sit. 
 
 We can use the formula for permutations with repetition: 
 
 P(n,r) = n^r 
 
 Here, n = 3 (representatives from England) and r = 9 (total representatives). 
 
 So, P(3,9) = 3^9 
 
 Therefore, the total number of ways the representatives can sit is 3^9. 
 
 Now, we need to find the number of ways the representatives from England can sit. 
 
 We can use the formula for combinations with repetition: 
 
 C(n,r) = n+r-1Cr 
 
 Here, n = 3 (representatives from England) and r = 3 (total representatives from England). 
 
 So, C(3,3) = 3+3-1C3 
 
 Therefore, the number of ways the representatives from England can sit is 3C3.

 First, we need to find the total number of ways the representatives can sit. 
 
 We can use the formula for circular permutations: 
 
 P(n) = (n-1)! 
 
 Here, n = 9 (total representatives). 
 
 So, P(9) = (9-1)! = 8! = 40320 
 
 Now, we need to find the number of ways the representatives can sit around a circular table, if representatives of the same country sit together. 
 
 We can use the formula for circular permutations with restrictions: 
 
 P(n,r) = (n-r)!

 There are 8 boys and 6 girls in the trumpet section.
 
 To form a quintet, we need 3 boys and 2 girls.
 
 So, the total number of quintets that can be formed = Number of ways of selecting 3 boys from 8 boys x Number of ways of selecting 2 girls from 6 girls
 
 Number of ways of selecting 3 boys from 8 boys = 8C3 = 56
 
 Number of ways of selecting 2 girls from 6 girls = 6C2 = 15
 
 So, the total number of quintets that can be formed = 56 x 15 = 840

The probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, so $m/n > 1/6$. 

The probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, so $(n-m)/n < 1/6$. 

The probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, so $(n-2m)/n = 1/6$. 

The sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7, so $m + (n-m) = 7$. 

Combining all the equations, we get $m + n = 13$. 

Therefore, [[Answer: 13]]

The probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, so $m/n > 1/6$. 

The probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, so $1-m/n < 1/6$. 

The probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, so $1-2m/n = 1/6$. 

The sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7, so $m+n = 7$. 

Therefore, $m+n = 7$.

 Step 1: The perimeter of an isosceles triangle is given as 10. 
 
 Step 2: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its three sides. 
 
 Step 3: Therefore, 10 = x + x + y, where x and y are the two sides of the triangle. 
 
 Step 4: Solving the equation, we get x = 5 - y and y = 5 - x. 
 
 Step 5: Since the sides of the triangle must be integers, we can substitute the values of x and y in the equation. 
 
 Step 6: We get 10 = 5 - y + 5 - y + y, which simplifies to 10 = 10 - 2y. 
 
 Step 7: Solving the equation, we get y = 5. 
 
 Step 8: Substituting the value of y in the equation x = 5 - y, we get x = 0. 
 
 Step 9: Therefore, the two sides of the isosceles triangle are 5 and 0. 
 
 Step 10: Since the sides of the triangle must be non-congruent, the number of isosceles triangles with integer sides is 0.

 Step 1: We know that the perimeter of an isosceles triangle is 10. 
 
 Step 2: We also know that the side lengths of an isosceles triangle must be integers. 
 
 Step 3: We can calculate the number of non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 by using the formula: 
 
 Number of non-congruent isosceles triangles = (Perimeter - 2) / 2
 
 Therefore, the number of non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 is: 
 
 [[Answer: 4]]
RESPONSE . 
 
 Step 1: We know that the perimeter of the triangle is 10. 
 
 Step 2: We also know that the triangle is isosceles, which means two sides are equal. 
 
 Step 3: We need to find the number of non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths. 
 
 Step 4: We can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is P = a + b + c, where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle. 
 
 Step 5: We can substitute the value of the perimeter in the formula to get 10 = a + a + c. 
 
 Step 6: We can solve this equation to get c = 5 - a. 
 
 Step 7: We know that the sides of the triangle must be integers, so we can substitute different values of a to get different combinations of integer sides. 
 
 Step 8: We can see that the possible combinations of integer sides are (2,2,6), (3,3,4) and (4,4,2). 
 
 Step 9: Therefore, there are 3 non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths. 
 
 Answer: [[3]]
RESPONSE . 
 
 Step 1: Let us assume the side lengths of the isosceles triangle as x, x and y. 
 
 Step 2: Since the perimeter of the triangle is 10, we can write the equation as x + x + y = 10. 
 
 Step 3: Solving the equation, we get x + y = 10 - x. 
 
 Step 4: Since the side lengths should be integers, we can substitute x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
 
 Step 5: For each value of x, we can calculate the value of y. 
 
 Step 6: For each value of x and y, we can check if the triangle is isosceles or not. 
 
 Step 7: If the triangle is isosceles, we can check if the side lengths are integers or not. 
 
 Step 8: If the side lengths are integers, we can check if the perimeter is 10 or not. 
 
 Step 9: If the perimeter is 10, we can count the number of such triangles. 
 
 Hence, the answer is [[Answer: 4]]

 Step 1: We know that the perimeter of an isosceles triangle is 10. 
 
 Step 2: We also know that the two sides of the triangle are equal. 
 
 Step 3: We can calculate the length of the third side using the formula: 
 
 Perimeter = 2*side1 + side2 
 
 Therefore, side2 = 10 - 2*side1 
 
 Step 4: We can now calculate the number of non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths. 
 
 For side1 = 1, side2 = 8 
 For side1 = 2, side2 = 6 
 For side1 = 3, side2 = 4 
 
 Therefore, there are 3 non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths.

 We know that perfect cubes are numbers which can be expressed as the cube of an integer.
 
 So, we need to find the number of integers in the list which cannot be expressed as the cube of an integer.
 
 We can find this by subtracting the number of perfect cubes from the total number of integers in the list.
 
 The total number of integers in the list is $250-25+1=226$.
 
 The number of perfect cubes in the list can be found by finding the cube root of $250$ which is $5$.
 
 So, the number of perfect cubes in the list is $5-2+1=4$.
 
 Therefore, the number of integers in the list which are not perfect cubes is $226-4=222$.

 First, let us find the difference between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$.
 
 $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2 - \dfrac{17}{3} = \dfrac{289}{9} - \dfrac{17}{3} = \dfrac{272}{9}$
 
 Now, let us convert this difference into an integer.
 
 $\dfrac{272}{9} = 30$
 
 Therefore, the difference between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is 30.
 
 Now, let us find the number of integers between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$.
 
 Since the difference between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is 30, the number of integers between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is 30 - 1 = 29.

 First, we can arrange the books in 8! ways.
 
 Then, we need to subtract the number of ways in which two books of the same type are adjacent.
 
 We can have two math books adjacent in 7! ways, two history books adjacent in 7! ways, and two physics books adjacent in 7! ways.
 
 So, the total number of ways in which two books of the same type can be adjacent is 3 x 7!
 
 Therefore, the total number of ways in which the books can be arranged if no two books of the same type can be adjacent is 8! - 3 x 7!

If we have an unlimited supply of books, then we can have any combination of math, history and physics books on the shelf. 

For example, we can have 4 math books, 2 history books and 2 physics books on the shelf. 

The first answer would be the total number of possible combinations of books on the shelf, which is infinite. 

The second answer would be the total number of books that can fit on the shelf, which is 8. 

Therefore, the difference between the two answers is that the first answer is infinite, while the second answer is 8. [[Answer: Infinite and 8]]

 First, let us find the difference between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$.
 
 $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2 - \dfrac{17}{3} = \dfrac{289}{9} - \dfrac{17}{3} = \dfrac{272}{9}$
 
 Now, let us convert this difference into an integer.
 
 $\dfrac{272}{9} = 30$
 
 Therefore, the difference between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is 30.
 
 Now, let us find the number of integers between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$.
 
 Since the difference between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is 30, the number of integers between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is 30 - 1 = 29.
 
 Therefore, the number of integers between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is 29.

 We can do this by counting the number of numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least once. 
 
 The numbers that contain the digit $6$ at least once are $6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 66, 76, 86, 96, 106, 116, 126, 136, 146, 156, 166, 176, 186, 196, 206, 216, 226, 236, 246, 256, 266, 276, 286, 296, 306, 316, 326, 336, 346, 356, 366, 376, 386, 396, 406, 416, 426, 436, 446, 456, 466, 476, 486, 496, 506, 516, 526, 536, 546, 556, 566, 576, 586, 596, 606, 616, 626, 636, 646, 656, 666, 676, 686, 696, 706, 716, 726, 736, 746, 756, 766, 776, 786, 796, 806.$
 
 Therefore, the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least once is $80$. 
 
 Now, let us find the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice. 
 
 We can do this by counting the number of numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice. 
 
 The numbers that contain the digit $6$ at least twice are $66, 166, 266, 366, 466, 566, 666, 766.$
 
 Therefore, the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice is $8$.

 First, let us consider the lines passing through two points. 
 
 There are 9 pairs of points in the set $S$. 
 
 For each pair of points, there is one line passing through them. 
 
 So, there are 9 lines passing through two points. 
 
 Now, let us consider the lines passing through three points. 
 
 There are 3 triplets of points in the set $S$. 
 
 For each triplet of points, there is one line passing through them. 
 
 So, there are 3 lines passing through three points. 
 
 Finally, let us consider the lines passing through four points. 
 
 There is only one quadruplet of points in the set $S$. 
 
 For this quadruplet of points, there is one line passing through them. 
 
 So, there is one line passing through four points. 
 
 Therefore, the total number of distinct lines passing through at least two members of $S$ is

 First, let us find the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least once. 
 
 We can do this by counting the number of numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least once. 
 
 The numbers that contain the digit $6$ at least once are $6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 66, 76, 86, 96, 106, 116, 126, 136, 146, 156, 166, 176, 186, 196, 206, 216, 226, 236, 246, 256, 266, 276, 286, 296, 306, 316, 326, 336, 346, 356, 366, 376, 386, 396, 406, 416, 426, 436, 446, 456, 466, 476, 486, 496, 506, 516, 526, 536, 546, 556, 566, 576, 586, 596, 606, 616, 626, 636, 646, 656, 666, 676, 686, 696, 706, 716, 726, 736, 746, 756, 766, 776, 786, 796, 806.$
 
 Therefore, the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least once is $80$. 
 
 Now, let us find the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice. 
 
 We can do this by counting the number of numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice. 
 
 The numbers that contain the digit $6$ at least twice are $66, 166, 266, 366, 466, 566, 666, 766.$
 
 Therefore, the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice is $8$. 
 
 Hence, the answer is [[Answer: 8]].

 We know that there are 5 upper class soldiers and 10 lower class soldiers in a certain part of Athens. We also know that the battle of Thermopylae demands a force of 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers.

Therefore, the number of different battalions that can be sent is equal to the number of ways we can choose 4 upper class soldiers from 5 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers from 10 lower class soldiers. This can be calculated using the formula:

Number of different battalions = (5C4) x (10C8)

A hexagon has 6 sides.

Each side has one end point.

So, the hexagon has 6 end points.

Each end point is connected to the other 5 end points.

So, the hexagon has 6 lines connecting the end points.

Each line has two end points.

So, the hexagon has 12 end points of the lines.

Each end point of the line is connected to the other 5 end points of the lines.

So, the hexagon has 12 lines connecting the end points of the lines.

Therefore, the hexagon has 12 diagonals.

The outermost circle has a radius of 20 inches.
The next circle has a radius of 15 inches.
The next circle has a radius of 10 inches.
The innermost circle has a radius of 6 inches.

Therefore, the total area of the target is the sum of the areas of all the circles.

Area of outermost circle = œÄ √ó 20¬≤ = 400œÄ
Area of next circle = œÄ √ó 15¬≤ = 225œÄ
Area of next circle = œÄ √ó 10¬≤ = 100œÄ
Area of innermost circle = œÄ √ó 6¬≤ = 36œÄ

Total area of target = 400œÄ + 225œÄ + 100œÄ + 36œÄ = 761œÄ

Therefore, the probability of a dart landing in a non-shaded region is 761œÄ/9 = 84.55œÄ.

 First, we need to find the total number of three-letter sequences that can be formed using the six letters of $TARGET$.
 
 We can use the formula for permutations with repetition:
 
 $P_{r}^{n} = n^r$
 
 Here, $n$ is the number of letters and $r$ is the number of places.
 
 So, the total number of three-letter sequences that can be formed using the six letters of $TARGET$ is $6^3 = 216$.
 
 Now, we need to find the number of three-letter sequences with at least one $T$.
 
 We can use the formula for combinations with repetition:
 
 $C_{r}^{n} = \frac{(n+r-1)!}{r!(n-1)!}$
 
 Here, $n$ is the number of letters and $r$ is the number of places.
 
 So, the number of three-letter sequences with at least one $T$ is $\frac{(6+3-1)!}{3!(6-1)!} = 84$.
 
 Therefore, the answer is [[Answer: 84]].

 Third, we know that 180 take calculus.
 
 Fourth, we know that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics.
 
 Fifth, we know that 75 take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry.
 
 Sixth, we know that only 30 take both physics and calculus.
 
 Now, let us use variables to represent the unknowns.
 
 Let x = number of students taking physics
 
 Let y = number of students taking chemistry
 
 We know that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics, so we can write:
 
 y = 2x
 
 We also know that 180 take calculus, so we can write:
 
 x + y + 30 = 180
 
 Substituting y = 2x, we get:
 
 x + 2x + 30 = 180
 
 Simplifying, we get:
 
 3x = 150
 
 Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
 
 x = 50
 
 Substituting x = 50 in y = 2x, we get:
 
 y = 2(50) = 100
 
 Therefore, the number of students taking physics and chemistry is 100.

 The probability of getting a number other than 1 in a single dice is $\frac{5}{6}$.
 
 The probability of getting a number other than 1 in two dice is $\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}$.
 
 The probability of getting a number other than 1 in $n$ dice is $\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} \times \cdots \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36^n}$.
 
 Now, we know that the probability of getting exactly two of them showing a number other than 1 is $\frac{25}{216}$.
 
 So, $\frac{25}{216} = \frac{25}{36^n}$

 We know that the smallest three-digit positive integer is 100. 
 
 The largest three-digit positive integer is 999. 
 
 We need to find the number of multiples of 11 between 100 and 999. 
 
 We can use the formula for finding the number of multiples of a number between two given numbers. 
 
 The formula is: 
 
 Number of multiples = (Largest number - Smallest number + 1)/Divisor 
 
 Here, 
 
 Largest number = 999 
 
 Smallest number = 100 
 
 Divisor = 11 
 
 So, 
 
 Number of multiples = (999 - 100 + 1)/11 
 
 = 90/11 
 
 = 8 
 
 Hence, there are 8 three-digit positive integers which are multiples of 11.

 First, the question asks us to use variables for unknowns. So, we can assign variables to the number of students, girls, boys, and jerseys.
 
 Let us assign the following variables:
 
 Number of students = x
 Number of girls = y
 Number of boys = z
 Number of jerseys = a
 
 Then, the question states that there are 12 students, 6 girls and 6 boys. So, we can substitute the values in the variables:
 
 x = 12
 y = 6
 z = 6
 
 Finally, the question states that there are 4 jerseys in each of 3 colors. So, we can substitute the value in the variable:
 
 a = 4 x 3 = 12
 
 Therefore, the difference between the two responses is that the first response assigns variables to the unknowns, while the second response substitutes the values in the variables.

Let $x$ be the number of pictures Trilisa takes.

The probability of at least one picture turning out is given by $1 - (\frac{4}{5})^x$.

We want this probability to be at least $\frac{3}{4}$.

So, $(\frac{4}{5})^x \leq \frac{1}{4}$

Taking logarithms on both sides,

$x \log(\frac{4}{5}) \leq \log(\frac{1}{4})$

 There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, but we cannot use the letter O. So, there are 25 letters available.
 
 For the first letter, we have 25 choices.
 
 For the second letter, we have 24 choices (since the first letter must be alphabetically before the second letter).
 
 For the first digit, we have 9 choices (since we cannot use 0).
 
 For the second digit, we have 8 choices (since the first digit must be smaller than the second digit).
 
 Therefore, the total number of possible license plate combinations is 25 x 24 x 9 x 8 = 50400.

 First, we can simplify the equation by subtracting 25 from both sides.
 
 $\left(\dfrac{x}{3}\right)^3-3x^2+81x-729-25=2(5)(3)+9-25$
 
 $\left(\dfrac{x}{3}\right)^3-3x^2+81x-754=0$
 
 Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$.
 
 $x=\dfrac{-81\pm\sqrt{81^2-4(1)(-754)}}{2(1)}$
 
 $x=\dfrac{-81\pm\sqrt{81^2+3024}}{2}$
 
 $x=\dfrac{-81\pm\sqrt{3105}}{2}$
 
 $x=\dfrac{-81\pm55.5}{2}$
 
 $x=\dfrac{-135.5}{2}$ or $\dfrac{26.5}{2}$
 
 Therefore, the real solutions are $x=-67.75$ and $x=13.25$.

 First, we need to find the total number of four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5.
 
 We can use the formula for permutations with repetition:
 
 n^r
 
 where n is the number of objects (in this case, 4) and r is the number of places (in this case, 4).
 
 So, the total number of four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5 is 4^4 = 256.
 
 Now, we need to find the number of palindromes among these 256 four-digit integers.
 
 A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward.
 
 So, the number of palindromes among these 256 four-digit integers is 15.

 Next, we need to choose the first digit. We can choose any one of the four given digits (1, 2, 4, 6). 
 
 Finally, we need to choose two more digits. Since no digit can be repeated, we can choose any two digits from the remaining 9 digits (0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9).

 Step 3: We can move from the point $(2,0)$ to the point $(1,1)$ in one step. 
 
 Step 4: We can move from the point $(1,1)$ to the point $(0,2)$ in one step. 
 
 Step 5: We can move from the point $(0,2)$ to the point $(-1,1)$ in one step. 
 
 Step 6: We can move from the point $(-1,1)$ to the point $(-2,0)$ in one step. 
 
 Step 7: We can move from the point $(-2,0)$ to the point $(-1,-1)$ in one step. 
 
 Step 8: We can move from the point $(-1,-1)$ to the point $(0,-1)$ in one step. 
 
 Step 9: We can move from the point $(0,-1)$ to the point $(1,0)$ in one step.

 First, we need to find the total number of four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5.
 
 We can use the formula for finding the number of arrangements of n distinct objects taken r at a time:
 
 nPr = n!/(n-r)!
 
 Here, n = 4 and r = 4.
 
 Therefore, the total number of four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5 is 4P4 = 4!/(4-4)! = 24.
 
 Now, we need to find the number of palindromes among these 24 four-digit integers.
 
 A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward.
 
 Therefore, the number of palindromes among these 24 four-digit integers is 6.
 
 Hence, the answer is [[Answer: 6]].

 Finally, we need to choose 2 digits from $\{0,3,5,7,8,9\}$. This can be done in $\frac{6!}{2!}$ ways.
 
 Therefore, the total number of possible license plates is $\frac{5!}{2!} \times 4 \times \frac{6!}{2!}$ [[Answer: 5760]]

 Without parentheses, the expression is $8 + 4 \times 6 \div 2 = 8 + 24 \div 2 = 8 + 12 = 20$.
 
 Now, if we place parentheses around the $4 \times 6$ term, the expression becomes $8 + (4 \times 6) \div 2 = 8 + 24 \div 2 = 8 + 12 = 20$.
 
 If we place parentheses around the $8 + 4$ term, the expression becomes $(8 + 4) \times 6 \div 2 = 12 \times 6 \div 2 = 72 \div 2 = 36$.
 
 Thus, there are two distinct values possible for the expression $8 + 4 \times 6 \div 2$ if one set of parentheses may be placed in the expression.

1. 8 students play all three sports. 
2. Half the students play basketball. 
3. Ratio of the size of the math team to the size of the basketball team to the size of the soccer team is 4:3:2. 

Let us assume that the number of students playing basketball is $x$. 

Then, the number of students playing soccer is $\frac{3}{2}x$ and the number of students playing mathletics is $\frac{4}{2}x$. 

Therefore, the total number of students playing any of the three sports is $x + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 8x$. 

Since 8 students play all three sports, the total number of students playing any of the three sports is $8x - 8 = 60$. 

Therefore, $8x = 68$ and $x = 8.5$. 

Therefore, the number of students playing basketball is 8.5. 

The number of students playing soccer is $\frac{3}{2}x = 12.75$ and the number of students playing mathletics is $\frac{4}{2}x = 17$. 

Therefore, the number of students playing exactly one team is $60 - 8 - 8.5 - 12.75 - 17 = 21.75$. 

Therefore, the answer is [[Answer: 21.75]]

3. Ratio of the size of the math team to the size of the basketball team to the size of the soccer team is 4:3:2. 

Let us assume that the number of students playing basketball is $x$. 

Then, the number of students playing soccer is $\frac{3}{2}x$ and the number of students playing mathletics is $\frac{4}{2}x$. 

Therefore, the total number of students playing on at least one of the three teams is 

$x + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 8 + \frac{11}{2}x$

Since all 60 students play on at least one of the three teams, 

$8 + \frac{11}{2}x = 60$

$\frac{11}{2}x = 52$

$x = \frac{104}{11}$

Therefore, the number of students playing basketball is $\frac{104}{11}$. 

The number of students playing soccer is $\frac{3}{2}\times \frac{104}{11} = \frac{156}{11}$

The number of students playing mathletics is $\frac{4}{2}\times \frac{104}{11} = \frac{208}{11}$

The number of students playing exactly two teams is 

$\frac{104}{11} + \frac{156}{11} + \frac{208}{11} - 8 = \frac{568}{11}$

Therefore, the number of students playing exactly two teams is $\frac{568}{11}$.

Since $a\equiv 5\pmod {16},$ $b\equiv 10\pmod {16},$ and $c\equiv 15\pmod {16},$ we can write $a=5+16k,$ $b=10+16k,$ and $c=15+16k$ for some integer $k.$

Now, $t_a=t_{5+16k}=t_{5+16(k-1)}+t_{4+16(k-1)}=t_{5+16(k-2)}+t_{4+16(k-2)}+t_{5+16(k-1)}+t_{4+16(k-1)}=\cdots=t_5+t_4+t_3+\cdots+t_0$

Similarly, $t_b=t_{10+16k}=t_5+t_4+t_3+\cdots+t_0+t_9+t_8+\cdots+t_6$

and $t_c=t_{15+16k}=t_5+t_4+t_3+\cdots+t_0+t_9+t_8+\cdots+t_6+t_{14}+t_{13}+\cdots+t_7$

Therefore, $t_a+t_b+t_c=3t_5+3t_4+3t_3+3t_2+3t_1+3t_0+t_9+t_8+\cdots+t_7$

Now, $t_5=5,$ $t_4=3,$ $t_3=2,$ $t_2=3,$ $t_1=5,$ and $t_0=0.$

Therefore, $t_a+t_b+t_c=3\times 5+3\times 3+3\times 2+3\times 3+3\times 5+3\times 0+t_9+t_8+\cdots+t_7$

 This means that $26A7114B4C0$ is divisible by all the first 25 positive integers.
 
 We can rewrite the expression as $100 \times A + 10 \times B + C = 26A7114B4C0$.
 
 Therefore, $100 \times A + 10 \times B + C = 26A7114B4C0$.

Now, $t_a=t_{5+16k}=t_{5+16(k-1)}+t_{4+16(k-1)}=t_{5+16(k-2)}+t_{4+16(k-2)}+t_{5+16(k-1)}+t_{4+16(k-1)}=\cdots=t_5+t_4+t_3+\cdots+t_0$

Similarly, $t_b=t_{10+16k}=t_5+t_4+t_3+\cdots+t_0+t_9+t_8+\cdots+t_6$

and $t_c=t_{15+16k}=t_5+t_4+t_3+\cdots+t_0+t_9+t_8+\cdots+t_6+t_{14}+t_{13}+\cdots+t_7$

Therefore, $t_a+t_b+t_c=3t_5+3t_4+3t_3+3t_2+3t_1+3t_0+t_9+t_8+\cdots+t_7$

Now, $t_5=5,$ $t_4=3,$ $t_3=2,$ $t_2=3,$ $t_1=5,$ and $t_0=0.$

Therefore, $t_a+t_b+t_c=3\times 5+3\times 3+3\times 2+3\times 3+3\times 5+3\times 0+t_9+t_8+\cdots+t_7$

 A multiple of 4 is 4n, where n is any integer. 
 
 So, the positive integer is 3 more than 4n, which is 4n + 3. 
 
 A multiple of 5 is 5m, where m is any integer. 
 
 So, the positive integer is 4 more than 5m, which is 5m + 4. 
 
 Since 4n + 3 and 5m + 4 should be the same, we can equate them. 
 
 4n + 3 = 5m + 4 
 
 4n - 5m = 1 
 
 We can solve this equation to get the value of n and m. 
 
 n = (5m + 1)/4 
 
 Since n and m are integers, 5m + 1 should be divisible by 4. 
 
 The least value of 5m + 1 that is divisible by 4 is 4. 
 
 So, 5m + 1 = 4 
 
 m = -3 
 
 n = (4 - 1)/4 = 3/4 
 
 Since n and m should be integers, we can take the least integer value of n and m. 
 
 n = 3 
 m = -3 
 
 Substituting the values of n and m in 4n + 3, we get 
 
 4(3) + 3 = 15

 Step 2: We can solve this congruence by using the Euclidean Algorithm.
 
 Step 3: We have $40 = 27 \times 1 + 13$ and $27 = 13 \times 2 + 1$.
 
 Step 4: We can use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse of $27$ modulo $40$.
 
 Step 5: We have $1 = 27 - 13 \times 2$ and $1 = 40 - 27 \times 1$.
 
 Step 6: Thus, the inverse of $27$ modulo $40$ is $13$.
 
 Step 7: Therefore, the smallest and second-smallest positive integers $a$ satisfying the congruence $$27a\equiv 17 \pmod{40}~$$ are $a = 1$ and $a = 13$.

 where $a_n$ is the most significant digit and $a_0$ is the least significant digit. 
 
 We know that $a_0 = 3$ for base $10$. 
 
 So, for the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ to end in the digit $3$, we need $a_0 = 3$. 
 
 This implies that $3$ must be a factor of $2013$.

 We know that the fraction $\frac{n}{99}$ is in lowest terms if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $n$ and $99$ is $1$. 
 
 The GCD of two numbers can be found using the Euclidean algorithm. 
 
 The Euclidean algorithm states that the GCD of two numbers is the last non-zero remainder when the two numbers are divided. 
 
 Therefore, the GCD of $n$ and $99$ is $1$ if the remainder when $n$ is divided by $99$ is $1$. 
 
 Since $0<n<99$, the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $99$ are $1,2,3,\ldots,98$.

 Step 1: We need to find the smallest and second-smallest positive integers $a$ satisfying the congruence $$27a\equiv 17 \pmod{40}~.$$
 
 Step 2: We can solve this congruence by using the Euclidean Algorithm.
 
 Step 3: We have $40 = 27 \times 1 + 13$ and $27 = 13 \times 2 + 1$.
 
 Step 4: We can use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse of $27$ modulo $40$.
 
 Step 5: We have $1 = 27 - 13 \times 2$ and $1 = 40 - 27 \times 1$.
 
 Step 6: Thus, the inverse of $27$ modulo $40$ is $13$.
 
 Step 7: Therefore, the smallest and second-smallest positive integers $a$ satisfying the congruence $$27a\equiv 17 \pmod{40}~$$ are $a = 1$ and $a = 13$.
 
 Step 8: Thus, the sum of the smallest and second-smallest positive integers $a$ satisfying the congruence $$27a\equiv 17 \pmod{40}~$$ is $1 + 13 = 14$.

 The base-$b$-representation of $2013$ is given by 
 
 $(a_na_{n-1}a_{n-2}...a_1a_0)_b$
 
 where $a_n$ is the most significant digit and $a_0$ is the least significant digit. 
 
 We know that $a_0 = 3$ for base $10$. 
 
 So, for the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ to end in the digit $3$, we need $a_0 = 3$. 
 
 This implies that $3$ must be a factor of $2013$. 
 
 So, the values of $b$ for which the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ ends in the digit $3$ are the factors of $2013$. 
 
 The factors of $2013$ are $1, 3, 11, 33, 67, 2013$. 
 
 So, the number of values of $b$ for which the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ ends in the digit $3$ is $6$.

 The first integer can be written as 4x + 3. 
 
 The second integer can be written as 3y + 1. 
 
 Since the remainder when divided by 5 is 1, 4x + 3 + 3y + 1 must be divisible by 5. 
 
 This means that 4x + 3 + 3y + 1 = 5z, where z is an integer. 
 
 Solving for x and y, we get x = 5z - 3 - 3y and y = (5z - 4)/3. 
 
 Since x and y must be integers, 5z - 3 - 3y must be divisible by 4 and 5z - 4 must be divisible by 3. 
 
 This means that 5z - 3 must be divisible by both 4 and 3, which implies that z must be divisible by 12. 
 
 Thus, z = 12t, where t is an integer. 
 
 Substituting this in the equation 4x + 3 + 3y + 1 = 5z, we get 4(5(12t) - 3 - 3y) + 3 + 3y + 1 = 5(12t). 
 
 Simplifying, we get 60t - 12 - 9y + 3 + 3y + 1 = 60t. 
 
 Simplifying further, we get -12 - 6y + 4 = 0. 
 
 Solving for y, we get y = 2. 
 
 Substituting this in the equation x = 5z - 3 - 3y, we get x = 5(12t) - 3 - 3(2) = 59t - 9. 
 
 Since x and y must be integers, 59t - 9 must be divisible by 4, which implies that t must be divisible by 4. 
 
 Thus, t = 4u, where u is an integer. 
 
 Substituting this in the equation x = 59t - 9, we get x = 59(4u) - 9 = 235u - 9. 
 
 Since x and y must be integers, 235u - 9 must be divisible by 4, which implies that u must be divisible by 4. 
 
 Thus, u = 4v, where v is an integer. 
 
 Substituting this in the

 Since $P$ is one less than $b$, we can say that $P = b - 1$.
 
 Now, we can substitute this in the equation given above.
 
 $$\begin{array}{@{}l@{\;}l@{}l@{}l} && & (b - 1)_b \\ & \times & & (b - 1)_b \\ \cline{2-4} & & 3 & 1_b, \\ \end{array} $$
 
 We can solve this equation to get the value of $b$.
 
 $$(b - 1)_b \times (b - 1)_b = 3 \times 1_b$$
 
 $$(b - 1)^2 = 3 \times 1$$
 
 $$b^2 - 2b + 1 = 3$$
 
 $$b^2 - 2b - 2 = 0$$
 
 $$(b - 4)(b + 1) = 0$$
 
 $$b = 4$$
