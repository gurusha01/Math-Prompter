The number of distinct positive divisors of $(30)^4$ excluding 1 and $(30)^4$ is the number of positive divisors of $(30)^4$ minus the number of divisors of 1 and $(30)^4$. 
The number of positive divisors of $(30)^4$ is \\(30^4\\cdot 4! = 30\\cdot 240\\cdot 120\\cdot 6\\cdot 2 = 1444000\\end{align*}
The number of divisors of 1 is 1, and the number of divisors of $(30)^4$ is \\(30^4\\cdot 4! = 30\\cdot 240\\cdot 120\\cdot 6\\cdot 2 = 144000\\end{align*}
Therefore, the number of distinct positive divisors of $(30)^4$ excluding 1 and $(30)^4$ is \\144000 - 1 - 14000 = 40\\end{align*}

We can then solve the congruence by noting that 8 is a multiple of 17, so we can write 8 = 17m for some integer m. 
Therefore, 5n = 17k = 17m, so we can write 5n = 17m - 17k. 
Since 17m - 17k is an integer, we can write 5n = 17m - 17k = 17(m - k). 
Since 17 is prime, we can write 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17(m - k) = 17 5

We can also see that the base $b$ must be less than 10, since 151 is greater than 1000. 
Therefore, the base $b$ must be between 3 and 10. 
We can then solve the equation for $b$ by using the fact that 5 and 23 are both prime numbers. 
Since 5 is a prime number, we can write 5 = 2*2 + 1. 
Similarly, 23 is also a prime number, so we can write 23 = 3*7 + 1. 
Therefore, we can write 5_b = 2_b + 1_b and 23_b = 3_b + 7_b + 1_b.

We can see that $10!$ is a multiple of 11, so it ends in 0. 
There are 10 digits in base 11, so there are 10 choices for the first digit, 9 choices for the second digit, 8 choices for the third digit, and so on. 
Therefore, the number of zeroes is \\frac{10!}{11^1\\cdot 1^2\\cdot 1^3\\cdot 1^4\\cdot 1^5\\cdot 1^6\\cdot 1^7\\cdot 1^8\\cdot 1^9}=\\frac{10!}{1^1\\cdot 1^2\\cdot 1^3\\cdot 1^4\\cdot 1^5\\cdot 1^6\\cdot 1^7\\cdot 1^8\\cdot 1^9}=\\frac{10!}{1^1\\cdot 1^2\\cdot 1^3\\cdot 1^4\\cdot 1^5\\cdot 1^6\\cdot 1^7\\cdot 1^8\\cdot 0

We can see that $a+b\equiv 2\pmod{10}$ and $2a+b\equiv 1\pmod{10}$ implies that $a\equiv 1\pmod{5}$ and $b\equiv 1\pmod{5}$. 
Since $a\equiv 1\pmod{5}$, we can write $a=5x+1$ for some integer $x$. 
Similarly, since $b\equiv 1\pmod{5}$, we can write $b=5y+1$ for some integer $y$. 
Then $a-b=5(x-y)+1$. 
Since $x-y$ is an integer, the last digit of $a-b$ is the same as the last digit of $5(x-y)+1$. 
The last digit of $5(x-y)+1$ is the same as the last digit of $5x-5y+1$. 
The last digit of $5x-5y+1$ is the same as the last digit of $5(2x-2y)+1$.

The given information tells us that the three-digit integer $XYD$ is 619 more than the original integer $XY$. 
We can write the original integer $XY$ as $XY=100a+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and ones digits respectively. 
Then the three-digit integer $XYD$ is $XYD=100a+b+D$, where $D$ is the digit at the end. 
We can see that the tens digit of $XYD$ is $10a+1$, and the ones digit is $b+D$. 
Therefore, the three-digit integer $XYD$ is $10a+1+b+D$. 
We can see that the tens digit of $XYD$ is $10a+1$, and the ones digit is $b+D$. 
Therefore, the three-digit integer $XYD$ is $10a+1+b+D$.

The given expression is the expansion of (24+15)^50. 
In general, the power of (x+y)^n is (x+y)^n=x^n+nx^{n-1}y+x^{n-1}y^n+x^ny^n+y^n. 
The first and last terms in the given expression are powers and the middle two terms both have coefficient 15, giving us a clue that this is a power of a binomial and can be written in the form (x+y)^n. 
In this case, x=24 and y=15, so our answer is (24+15)^50

We can see that $x^3$ is a positive factor of $10!$ if and only if $x^3$ is a factor of $10!$ and $x$ is a positive integer. 
Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers that are factors of $10!$. 
We can see that $10!$ is divisible by $2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, 720, 1440, 2880, 5760, 11520, 23040, 46080, 92160, 184320, 368640, 737280, 1474560, 2949120, 5898240, 11796480, 235929 6

The given expression is the expansion of (2+1)^3 * (3+1)^1 * (4+1)^3 * (5+1)^8. 
In general, the cube of (x+y)^3 is (x+y)^3=1x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+1y^3. 
The first and last terms in the given expression are cubes and the middle two terms both have coefficient 3, giving us a clue that this is a cube of a binomial and can be written in the form (x+y)^3
In this case, x=2, y=1, so our answer is (2+1)^3 * (3+1)^1 * (4+1)^3 * (5+1)^8
