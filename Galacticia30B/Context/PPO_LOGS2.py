We can compute the number of ways to choose 4 elements from a set of 4 elements by counting the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the set of 4 elements and then subtracting 1. 
The number of ways to choose 4 elements from the set of 4 elements is \\frac{4}{4} \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} - 1\\frac{4}{3} - 1 = \\frac{3}{2}
Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 elements from the set of 4 elements is \\frac{4}{4} \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{3}{2}

The probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. 
The probability of obtaining the face opposite to $F$ is $(n-m)/n$. 
The probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$. 
The probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $47/288$. 
The probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $m/n$ times the probability of obtaining a sum of 7, which is $47/288$. 
Therefore, $m/n = 47/288$. 
Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, we can write $m = pq$ and $n = rq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime and $r$ is a positive integer. 
Therefore, $m/n = pq/qr = p/r$. 
Since $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime, we can write $p = p_1p_2$ and $q = q_1q_ 29

We can solve this problem by considering the following cases. 
If the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

If $m$ and $n$ are not relatively prime, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$.

We can see that the decimal $0.1\overline{23}$ is a repeating decimal, so we can write it as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ with $a$ and $b$ being positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1. 
Since the decimal is repeating, we can write it as $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{10000} + \cdots$
We can see that the denominator is a multiple of 10, so we can write it as $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{10000} + \cdots = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{10000} + \cdots = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{10000} + \cdots = \frac{1}{1 556
