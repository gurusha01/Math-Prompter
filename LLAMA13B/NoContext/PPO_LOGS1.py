Total cost of 90 kg of oranges = 450 * 90 = 40500
Total selling price of 90 kg of oranges = 7.50 * 90 = 675
Percentage gain = (675 - 4050) / 4050 * 100 = 50%

Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20.
1 mile = 10 miles + 20 miles
10 miles / 10 miles per hour = 1 minute
20 miles / 20 miles per hour = 1 minute
1 mile = 2 minutes
