Let the height of the tower be h meters.
Let the speed of the car be v meters/sec.
Let the angle of elevation be θ degrees.

Now,
tan(θ) = h/v

Now,

Now,
v = h/tan(45)

Now,
v = h/0.7411

Now,
v = 0.9579h

Now,

The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person.

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512

Let us assume the train fare for one person is Rs.x

Then,

6 * (4/3)x + 8x = 1512

3x + 8x = 1512

 Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? A)10  B)23  C)16  D)18  E)12  
 ,

For the coin to land on heads 20 times, the probability of heads is 0.5^20 = 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 
  
                    The number of times the coin landed on heads is 12.
</s> 
 ,

For the coin to land on heads 20 times, the probability of heads is 1/2^20 = 1/1024.
So, the probability of tails is 1-1/1024 = 1023/1024.
So, the probability of tails is 1023/1024.
So, the probability of tails is 1023/1024.

#### OUTPUTS: ,
The product of three consecutive integers is 728.
Then, the sum of the three consecutive integers is 37.

### Response: Let the speed of the train be x E
#### OUTPUTS: ,
The capacity of the tank is the product of its length and width.
The length of the tank is 8 m and the width is 6 m.
Then, the capacity of the tank is 12000 litres.
### Input: A rectangular field is 1000 m × 1000 m. What is the area of the field? A)100000000000000000000000000000000000000000 D
#### OUTPUTS: ,
 5265526 = 5265526
 5265526 - 4169516 = 1100000
 1100000 = 1100000
 1100000 = 1100000
 1100000 = 1100000
 1100000 = 1100000
 1100000 = E
#### OUTPUTS: ,
The worker will take 30 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour.
Then, the worker will take 35 minutes to cycle from home to work at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.
