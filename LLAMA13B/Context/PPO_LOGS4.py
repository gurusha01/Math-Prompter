Therefore, we can write $f(x^2) + f(y^2) = f(x + y)^2 - 2xy$ as $f(x^2) = f(x + y)^2 - 2xy - f(y^2).$ 
We can then write the sum as
\[S = \sum_{n = -2019}^{2019} f(n) = \sum_{n = -2019}^{2019} f(n^2) - 2\sum_{n = -2019}^{2019} nf(n) - \sum_{n = -2019}^{2019} f(n^2).\]

The binomial theorem states that the expansion of (a+b)^n is \\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}a^k\\cdot b^{n-k}

\[ \frac{x^2}{50} - \frac{y^2}{22} = 2 \]
The foci are given by the points

We can see that $a$ and $b$ are both real numbers, so we can write $a = a_r + ib_r$ and $b = a_i + b_i$ where $a_r$ and $b_r$ are real numbers and $a_i$ and $b_i$ are imaginary numbers. 
We can also see that $|a| = 7$ and $|b| = 4$ implies that $a_r^2 + b_r^2 = 7$ and $a_i^2 + b_i^2 = 4$. 
We can then write $a = a_r + ib_r$ and $b = a_i + b_i$ as $a = (a_r + ib_r) + (a_i + b_i)$ and $b = (a_r + ib_r) + (a_i + b_i)$.

The vertices $A$ and $B$ are on the circle with equation $x^2+y^2=4$.

We can solve this problem by factoring the denominator. 
The denominator is (x-1)(x+1), so we can write the numerator as (2x^2-3x+5x-1)(x-1). 
We can then factor the numerator as (2x-1)(x+1)(x-1), so we can write the expression as \\frac{(2x-1)(x+1)(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \\frac{2x^2-3x+5x-1}{x^2-1}
The solutions are then \\frac{2x-1}{x-1} and \\frac{x+1}{x-1}

We can see that the given equation is equivalent to \\frac{z_1^2}{z_2^2} = 1. 
Since |z_1| = 5, we can write z_1 = 5e^{i\theta} for some real number \\theta. 
Similarly, we can write z_2 = 5e^{i\phi} for some real number \\phi. 
Therefore, \\frac{z_1^2}{z_2^2} = 1 \\implies \\frac{5^2e^{2i\theta}}{5^2e^{2i\phi}} = 1 \\implies \\frac{e^{2i\theta}}{e^{2i\phi}} = 1 \\implies \\theta - \phi = 0 \\implies \\theta = \phi \\implies \\frac{z_1}{z_2} = 1 \\implies \\frac{5e^{i\theta}}{5e^{i\phi}} = 1 \\implies \\theta = 0 \\implies \\theta = 0 \\implies \\frac{z_1}{z_2} = 1 \\implies \\frac{ 25

The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. 
We can rewrite the equation as $x^2-6x-29=0$. 
The discriminant of this equation is \\begin{align*} \Delta &= b^2-4ac\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)(b^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &= 29^2-4(a^2)\\ &=  27

We can see that the quadratic is of the form $x^2+bx+1$. 
Using the quadratic formula, we can rewrite this as $(x+m)^2-63$. 
We can then use the fact that $(x+m)^2-63=(x+m+63)(x+m-63)$ to rewrite the quadratic as $(x+m+63)(x+m-63)=(x+m)^2-63$. 
We can then use the fact that $(x+m)^2-63=(x+m)^2-63$ to rewrite the quadratic as $(x+m)^2-63=(x+m)^2-63$. 
We can then use the fact that $(x+m)^2-63=(x+m)^2-63$ to rewrite the quadratic as $(x+m)^2-63=(x+m)^2-63$. 
We can then use the fact that $(x+m)^2-63=(x+m)^2-63$ to rewrite the quadratic as $(x+m)^2-63=(x+ 16
